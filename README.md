# GELMS
## Overview
**GELMS (Generic Electronic Learning Management System)** is an online learning management system
that is designed to be both streamlined to the specific user and adaptive to the different educational
domains. In addition to the required features, GELMS will include a “tools” feature that will provide
users with access to tools that are relevant to their course (i.e. a calculator for an engineering student, an
instrument tuner for a music student). Different courses will also display aesthetics unique to their
educational domain. Next, GELMS will include a “reader mode” option for users with an impaired sight
disability. The different GELMS features are highlighted in the list below and are
divided up by the different users for clarity:

**Admin features**:
- Admins can add and remove courses
- Admins can add and remove students to a specific course
- Admins can assign a teacher, TA, and/or grader to a specific course

**Teacher features**:
- Teachers can post, edit, and remove announcements to specific course
- Teachers can post, edit, and remove a syllabus to a specific course
- Teachers can view a list of all people (students, teachers, TAs, graders) in a specific course
- Teachers can lock and unlock tools for a specific course
- Teachers can turn reader mode on and off


**Student features**:
- Students can view announcements for a specific course
- Students can view a syllabus for a specific course
- Students can view tools for a specific course
- Students can turn reader mode on and off

## Implementation
The backend is powered by the MVC framwork, Django written in Python.
## Working Prototype
This project is meant to be a prototype of a learning management system and is a result of applying software design principles and full-stack development skills for a practical example. The working/hosted project is hosted on the cloud service [*pythonanywhere*](gelms.pythonanywhere.com).
